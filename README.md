### This is a project about data cleaning of an Excel file using Pandas in Python. It involves: 
- deleting duplicates and a column (the Not_Useful_Column in this case)
- standardizing text and numeric columns (i.e. the LastName, PhoneNumber, PayingCustomer, and Do_Not_Contact columns)
- splitting a column (the Address column in this case) to get more useful information (e.g. Street, State, and Postcode)
- handling missing data (e.g. cells with N/a and NaN)
- creating a subset of the dataframe by removing the rows according to certain criteria ("Do_Not_Contact" in this case)
- resetting the index for the subset
- saving the cleaned dataset as an Excel file
